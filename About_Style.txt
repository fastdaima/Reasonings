

the clue is you are doing it wrong means : dont ask me to do the thinking for you


When you start your creative work will suck.

Why?

Because you won’t have your own style yet.

And that’s okay. What you can do is copy others until you do.
Take the works which impress you most and replicate them.

Have a movie you like?

Take one of your favourite lines from it and expand it into a story.

See someone with a business idea you thought was incredible?

Try it out in your own business.

Read a great article which had a killer paragraph somewhere towards the end?

Copy it out word for word, 
then rewrite it in your own voice. 
How would it sound if you had to explain it to someone 
else without reading it again? Write it like that.

Developing your own style takes time. It takes practice. 
It means making things you think are terrible 
but at the same time have the potential to bring others immense joy.

I used to see the work of others and get jealous.
Jealous mine wasn’t that good. Silly. I should’ve used it as inspiration.

Inspiration to make my own work better.

Whilst you’re figuring out the plot of your own narrative,
it’s okay to steal someone else’s, copy your favourites, 
combine them all and then sprinkle in a little of your own song.

And when you do end up finding your own style,
expect others to copy yours until they find theirs.
