Talking too much {
       when you talk too often, the words you speak holds less value.
}

Asking not related questions inside family too often {
       talking more than necessary
}

Not giving enough space to my brother {
       talking more than necessary
}

Too much food intake { 
       if you are not take care of yourself, who in the world do you think
       will save you.
}

Watching more content {
       if you are spending as much time in watching series, movies or dumb youtube 
       videos, in coding, I will become an greatest deep learning researcher of 
       all time. 
}

No consistent exercise routine {
       if you don't care about how you are, who in the world will give a crap 
       about you.
}

Actions needs to be done:

Enforcing Action reward Reinforcement learning system {
       if I don't spend 4 hours on craft before doing anyting, then the agent do
       not have any permission or face to other task.
}

finding the purpose of my life {
       only can be achieved from reading books, and thinking deeply and executing it.
}
