After some time siva found out his passion for programming, to solve complex problems through elegant code its his
utmost objective. He cared about nothing else, no tv, no mop stories, no sports, no girls, all he cared 
about was programming. As long as he have enough money to buy powerful pc, basic
food shelter and needs he was okay. 

He began to start working long hours, started embracing the grind. began reading masters of doom book, his 
entire reality about programming is changed. A big thanks to John Carmack.
